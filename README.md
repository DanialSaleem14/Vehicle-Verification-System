**🚗 Vehicle Verification System — Java + SQL + OpenCV + EasyOCR**
An advanced desktop-based Vehicle Verification System developed using Java (JFrame) for the frontend and SQL for data management. The system verifies vehicle records and handles gate entry and exit using image processing techniques.

🔍 Key Features:

📋 Vehicle registration verification via database.

🚪 Automated entry and exit detection of vehicles using OpenCV and EasyOCR.

🎥 Camera integration to read license plates at the gate in real-time.

🖥️ User-friendly interface designed with Java Swing (JFrame).

🗃️ SQL backend for secure and efficient data storage.

This project bridges software development and computer vision to simulate a smart gate system for vehicle authentication and tracking.
